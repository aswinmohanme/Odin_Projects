# Write a program which asks for a person's first name, then middle, then last.
# Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.
firstName = gets.chomp
middleName = gets.chomp
lastName = gets.chomp

puts 'Hello ' + firstName + ' ' + middleName + ' ' + lastName 

# Write a program which asks for a person's favorite number. Have your program
# add one to the number, then suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite
# number. (Do be tactful about it, though.)
